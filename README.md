# Marshmallow Frontend Test

Your task is to create a Javascript app that provides a brief overview of SpaceX's _rockets_ and _dragons_. ðŸš€ ðŸ›°

## What we'd like you to do

Build a React app with the functionality that meets the following requirements:

- Fetch and render a list of _rockets_ or _dragons_ from SpaceX's API.
- Show extended information about a selected list item in a separate box, modal or page.

> Question: "How should I position the list items?", "What data should I show in the full item view", "Do I need to bother with UI/UX?"

**Answer:** Completely up to you.

This task shouldn't take you longer than 2 or 3 hours to complete. However, you can spend as long as you want on it.

## Where do I find these rockets and dragons you speak of?

Please refer to [SpaceX's open API](https://docs.spacexdata.com/) for this task. The `/rockets` and `/dragons` endpoints should provide the necessary data.

## What should the UI look like?

What the UI looks like is completely up to you, however we suggest that it contains:

1. Buttons or tabs to switch between rockets and dragons.
2. A grid representation of the list.
3. A single item view with an extended description (containing an image, name, etc.).

> We have no specific styling requirements, you have **complete** freedom over what the UI looks like

## What should I use to build the app?

Feel free to use **any** tools that you are most efficient with:

Whether it's a `create-react-app` in [Codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) or a custom React build.

Get data using native [fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) or ['axios'](https://github.com/axios/axios).

You can style the UI using an existing CSS framework like `Bootstrap`, you can use [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/), or write your own vanilla CSS. Use whatever method of applying CSS you are comfortable with.
